**Functionality of the Image Mapping Website**

The website is designed to offer users a seamless experience in identifying coordinates and dimensions of an image using HTML image mapping techniques. At its core, the site serves developers, designers, or anyone working with image maps who need to pinpoint exact locations within an image.

One of the primary features is the **ability to locate the coordinates** of specific regions within an image. Users can upload any image file, and the website will display the image, allowing users to click on various areas. For each click, the website instantly provides the x and y coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the image. This simplifies the process of creating `map` and `area` tags in HTML, which are often tedious to do manually.

Additionally, the website offers a **tool for analyzing the size of the image**. Users can upload their images, and the website will return the dimensions (width and height) of the image. This is particularly useful for those working with responsive designs or when dealing with fixed size constraints.

Overall, the website provides an efficient and user-friendly solution to help users manage and map images effectively, enhancing their productivity when working with HTML image maps.
